# Description

I have developed a simple calculator as my first programming project. This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and select the desired operation using buttons.

The calculator accurately calculates the result based on the user's inputs and displays it on the screen. It also includes a clear button that allows users to reset the calculator and start a new calculation.

I implemented this calculator using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure of the calculator, while CSS is used for styling and making it visually appealing. JavaScript handles the logic and calculations behind each operation.

This project is a great introduction to programming and allows me to practice fundamental concepts such as user input, data manipulation, and event handling. I am proud of this achievement and look forward to further enhancing my programming skills through more complex projects in the future.

If you would like to see or try out the calculator, please let me know, and I will be happy to share the link or provide any additional information.
